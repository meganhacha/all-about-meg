### Howdy! ###
This is a web app actively being worked on by myself. It was born from the realization of the importance of displaying my own talents and selling my skills to an employer. In short, I get more experience with full-stack web development and a great inclusion on my resume. Win-win! 

### Some Backstory ###
The initial idea was just making a blog where I could rant about perfumes I've tried (my Google Doc is getting way too full for it to be efficient), coffee, life, whatever book I get myself to read (_The Divine Comedy_ is the current one, for those curious). The idea then grew into what's more of a "Here's me!" app. Go big or go home, some may say. And I agree.
